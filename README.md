### 🎮 SCL Gaming Boost - Advanced Windows Optimization for Gamers 🎮

🔁 Summary of Improvements v1.2.0.0

🔁 I added a checkbox for “CPU Core Parking” and inserted the logic to activate the “Ultimate Performance” power plan.

🔁 New feature to detect and load the user's preferred language, adding a drop-down menu for language selection and dynamically updating the GUI text.

**SCL Gaming Boost** is a powerful Windows utility designed for demanding gamers. With a single click, it optimizes your operating system by disabling non-essential services, reducing telemetry, and applying intelligent tweaks to boost in-game performance.

**⚠️ Note:** Some optimizations require administrator rights. Be sure to run the program as an administrator.
