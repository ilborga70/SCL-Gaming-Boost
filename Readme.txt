## üéÆ Sniper Elite V2 Remastered Benchmark: Windows 11 Game Mode vs. SCL Gaming Boost

We ran two benchmark tests on Sniper Elite V2 Remastered using identical hardware and graphics settings. The only difference? One test used Windows 11's built-in Game Mode, while the other added a feature called **SCL Gaming Boost**.

### üñ•Ô∏è Test Setup (Identical for Both Runs)

- **CPU:** Intel Core i5-13600KF  
- **GPU:** NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080  
- **RAM:** 64 GB  
- **Resolution:** 2560 x 1080  
- **Graphics Settings:** ULTRA preset, V-Sync OFF, Supersampling OFF

### üìä Performance Comparison

| Metric                | Game Mode Only | Game Mode + SCL Gaming Boost |
|----------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Average FPS**      | 710.9          | 730.3                         |
| **Minimum FPS**      | 226.4          | 270.2                         |
| **Maximum FPS**      | 1378.4         | 1342.3                        |
| **Avg. Frame Time**  | 1.407 ms       | 1.369 ms                      |
| **Min. Frame Time**  | 0.725 ms       | 0.745 ms                      |
| **Max. Frame Time**  | 4.416 ms       | 3.700 ms                      |

### üß† Analysis & Takeaways

The clear winner here is the setup with **SCL Gaming Boost** enabled. Here's why:

- ‚úÖ **Average FPS** increased by ~2.7%, from 710.9 to 730.3. That means smoother overall performance and more frames rendered per second.
- üöÄ **Minimum FPS** jumped from 226.4 to 270.2 ‚Äî a crucial improvement for gameplay fluidity. Higher minimums reduce sudden frame drops and micro-stutters.
- ‚ö° **Average Frame Time** dropped from 1.407 ms to 1.369 ms. Lower frame times = faster image rendering = snappier responsiveness.
- üìâ **Maximum FPS** dipped slightly (1378.4 ‚Üí 1342.3), but this has negligible impact since both values far exceed the 200 Hz refresh rate of the monitor.
- üß© **Maximum Frame Time** saw a notable reduction (4.416 ms ‚Üí 3.700 ms), meaning fewer extreme spikes and smoother frame pacing.

### üèÅ Final Verdict

If you're chasing ultra-smooth gameplay and stability, enabling **SCL Gaming Boost** on top of Windows 11 Game Mode delivers measurable benefits ‚Äî especially in minimum FPS and frame time consistency. It's not a massive leap, but it's a meaningful one for competitive or high-refresh gaming.
