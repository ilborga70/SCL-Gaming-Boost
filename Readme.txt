- ✅ **Summary of the Change**  
  I added an if block inside Load-Preferences that checks the saved state.
  If $global:gamingActive is true, the script reapplies the optimisations by calling Start-GamingBoost with the correct preferences.
  This ensures that the settings are not only displayed as active, but are also actually reapplied to the system, solving the persistence issue after restarting.
